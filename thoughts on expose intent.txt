want to walk
look for novel sounds, rhythm
when i have energy, look for ways to expend it - get ideas for expending from inner rhythms or outer rhythms or random/explor movements
rover has natural harmonics - maybe link to them
extract rhythms from environment and react to them (think of snake charmer)
3rd source - random. increase random movement, exploration, risk when it has energy, etc. risk, etc. depends on mood, energy level
happiness = i was successful recently so i am willing to take more risk
like a kitten - even smallest stimuli can cause a burst of reaction/playfulness. also excess energy can simply trigger doing an activity
of course, maybe rover has a personality, not only emotions/mood
personal style = (maybe) set of heuristics that a rover uses
use play time to learn movements
some unknown bridging steps can be found by playing. but note i need to detect something interesting happened. maybe by detecting elegance (compresibility). maybe by detecting novely instead, like novel change in position.
maybe constant sway, like when lulling a baby
