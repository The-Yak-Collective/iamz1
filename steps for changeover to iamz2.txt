steps:
1. update python to 3.9 
do that freeze thingee and switch the python3 link

no cupshelpers
no distro-info
no unknown...
lxml failed to install
trying to build numpy 1.16.2; failed - maybe we can download it?
failed pygame
failed pycups
failed pycocotools (due to missing numpy)
failed pyGObject
failed pysmbc
failed python-apt
failed RTIMUlib
failed scikit-image (due to missing numpy)
failed scipy (due to missing numpy)
failed tflite
failed typed-ast
failed unattended-upgrades

freeze did not quite work as cv failed, so trying to do freeze but install w/o dependencies
but that really needs numpy to be installed, as some pcakages want numpy

2. see that spider program still works
-> problem. mainly with numpy and cv2
3. see that iamz1 still works
-> other startup things fail. again, maybe due to cv2, maybe other things
4. copy iamz1 to iamz2
5. change crontab to point to iamz2/startup
6. also for iamz1 create a startp file for cron
7. sent /etc/enviroment variable for $IAMZ2, to use in all relative code. will add more later, liek for storage
